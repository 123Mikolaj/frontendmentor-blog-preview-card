## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Implement a mobile-first design approach for better responsiveness.
- Utilize Flexbox to align and distribute space among elements effectively.
- Handle image loading efficiently to prevent layout shifting and improve page performance. This includes using the `loading="lazy"` attribute for lazy loading images and setting explicit `width` and `height` attributes to reserve space, which prevents content from shifting as images load.
- Apply CSS custom properties to maintain a consistent color scheme.
